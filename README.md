# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This material is in the appendix on Canvas, but we judged it important enough to include in the lecture material. The main goal here is to introduce the distinctive layers found in CNNs and run through a demo with `keras` on the MNIST data.

## Learning Goals

- Describe the types of layers that are distinctive for convolutional nets
- Utilize `tensorflow` to build CNNs
- Evaluate CNN models

## Lecture Materials
